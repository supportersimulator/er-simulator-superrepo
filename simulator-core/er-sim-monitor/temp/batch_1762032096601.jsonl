He is a staff physian at McMaster Children’s Hospital, scholar with the McMaster Education Research, Innovation and Theory (MERIT) program and Founding Program Director for the Pediatric Emergency Medicine subspecialty residency program.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam is on faculty at an academic pediatric residency program with an interest in simulation enhanced education.  Sam’s interest in simulation started in fellowship and she’s since taken multiple debriefing courses and regularly attended medical simulation conferences since joining the faculty in an effort to expand her community of practice.  She’s also a keen and recognized medical educator within the department.  After the program identified a gap in resuscitation training opportunities for their learners, she set up a longitudinal simulation based training curriculum for the learners of the curriculum, based on the objectives of training of the specialty and a needs assessment conducted by the program of relevant stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program has been active for 2 years and Sam has been reviewing the program evaluation data for the simulation curriculum.  While the overall feedback has been positive, there are some areas of weakness that have been brought up consistently.  Feedback from the junior learners has included comments about how they can feel very lost and confused when they first join the simulation training sessions because of the chaos they feel in the room; they feel that it’s difficult to learn how to incorporate the basics of CPR and advanced airway management into a more complex scenario.  The senior learners appreciate the opportunities but find it can be frustrating after debriefing to not be able to practice what they identified were gaps in their performance, especially given that the size of the program was large and they may only get 4 or 5 sessions per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the above, Sam is concerned that her learners aren’t maximizing the effectiveness of their learning and sets about looking for a solution the problem presented by her learners.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nothing is as practical as a good theory – Deliberate Practice</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Attributed to Dr. K. Anders Ericsson and his extensive study of expertise, deliberate practice is the idea that expert level performance is not the result of innate talents, but rather acquired through years of focused practice in a specific area. Moreover, not all practice is equal and that it is deliberate practice which distinguishes people who  attain a basic proficiency and someone who becomes a master in that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studying fields as diverse as music, sports and chess, Ericsson found that innate abilities had little to do with the development of expertise. Rather, years of practice appeared to determine ability rather than genetic predispositions (with the exception of height and body size – height is essential to play elite level basketball, and cannot be modified regardless of practice).  Even amongst those considered gifted or talented from an early age, years of practice appears to predict their ability to acquire expert levels of ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core to the theory is the idea that not all practice is equal – simply practicing something repetitively does not develop the skills necessary for mastery (ie. having experience does not make you an expert – driving for 10 years does not make you an excellent driver). Deliberate practice appears to have the following characteristics in common, regardless of the field studied:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Requires a motivated learner</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires a specific and attainable goal with a well defined task</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires immediate feedback, usually with the help of an instructor or coach</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires time to practice with incorporation of the feedback</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have described deliberate practice feeling uncomfortable, as the task and goal are often just beyond the current skillset of the learner and requires focus and effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice vs Traditional Sim Teaching</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional medical simulation follows a reflective learning model: following a prebrief, the learners would go through a full simulation session and then undergo a facilitated debrief with the learners reflecting on their performance and exploring the cognitive frames behind their actions. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"5176\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/trad-sim-model/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1030,537\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Trad Sim model\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=700\" width=\"700\" height=\"364\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5176\" style=\"width:598px;height:312px\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=700 700w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=150 150w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=300 300w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=768 768w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif?w=1024 1024w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trad-sim-model.gif 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>Figure 1.

RCDP cycles</strong></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>RCDP was developed and described by Dr. Hunt and colleagues as a response to a program of research looking at delays and errors in CPR in pediatrics residents.  In one of their studies looking at the above, they found that the majority of their learners did not meet the standard of initiating CPR and defibrillating a simulation patient in a prespecified amount of time, regardless of training level or enrolment in courses.  Most interestingly (and perhaps obviously in retrospect), they found the main predictor of a learner defibrillating a simulated patient effectively was if they had actually done it previously.  As you imagine, for certain competencies, mastery is of utmost importance and that learning something efficiently matters given the amount of time with a learner or team may be limited. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt and colleagues describe RCDP as “rapid cycle between deliberate practice and directed feedback until skill mastery is achieved” after which progression in case difficulty can proceed.  This model includes drilling/practicing the “right way” to take advantage of overlearning as described above); relying on expert feedback to show the learner the gold standard rather than having them figure it out; and psychological safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In considering whether or not to use RCDP as a simulation method, it is important to understand in what contexts it is most likely to be successful. Consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>When teaching them “how” is as important as teaching them “what”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When repetition and muscle memory are important (ie. CPR)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When pattern recognition is important – consider if/and protocols such as if you see ventricular fibrillation, you should defibrillate</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When communication scripts are important</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When choreography is important – consider the organization of a chaotic room in the first five minutes of a resuscitation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When practicing the use of cognitive aids – consider a Broselow tape or a ACLS card and knowing where the necessary information is located</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Live. Die. Repeat. The Mechanics of RCDP</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking time at this point to orient the learner is important to establish the expectations of the session, teach them the process and how it differs from traditional simulation and to create an atmosphere of psychological safety where the learner understands that you are trying to help them perform at their best.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>“Vegas” Rules – emphasize confidentiality and that what happens in the session stays in the session</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prepare them for focussed feedback – learners are not used to being interrupted and this can be very disorientating so making sure they understand this will happen is important</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Normalizing mistakes – make clear that we are looking to help you succeed and make clear the goals of the session</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creating an encouraging environment – being a coach means being interested, invested in their progress and enthusiastic</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Initial simulation to identify gaps and confirm need for training – don’t interrupt the first attempt – this serves 2 purposes: first, it leverages principles of adult learning theory and shows them that they themselves have a gap; secondly, it allows you as an instructor to diagnose the learner</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Level up – start with easy cases with things seen and skills needed most frequently thus getting most repetition – build up to required skills that are essential but used less frequently</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Drill – interrupt when they make a mistake on a skill previously worked on – don’t let them move on until the skill/idea is incorporated. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Back up plan – plan for additional lessons/skills if the team is advancing faster than expected or be prepared to focus on essential skills if time is running out</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that if something is not working despite multiple attempts at fixing the problem with a focused debriefing approach, it may be necessary to go back to your advocacy/inquiry model in order to try and understand the reason why something isn’t working.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Back to the Problem…</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam identifies Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) as a potential solution to her simulation program dilemma.  She decides to separate the 1<sup>st</sup> year residents from the rest of the residents and develops a RCDP curriculum for them specifically aimed at developing the skills of managing the “First Five Minutes” of a resuscitation.  These objectives include mastery of basic skills such as Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation, high quality CPR, Defibrillation, Intraosseous Placement, organization of a team during a resuscitation and effective leadership/followership.  The plan is to master these skills over the course of the first 6 – 12 months of their first year of residency before joining the upper year residents.  She also plans a refresher RCDP session yearly for upper year residents in order to reinforce their learning of the basics of setting up a resuscitation and their knowledge of PALS algorithms.  She reasons that if they spent their first year mastering these foundational skills, they could space out the sessions in later years knowing that they will need less frequent refreshers over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">**New** RCDP Cases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>July 28, 2025 – Check out these three cases designed for rapid cycle deliberate practice.

This case provides an opportunity to practice identification and treatment of multiple sources of blood loss in hemorrhagic shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>25 year-old male was involved in a boating accident. He was waterskiing and was struck by another boat at high speeds. He sustained significant propeller injuries to right leg, unstable pelvis, and abdominal bruising. No LOC but altered with some reported alcohol consumption. Was wearing a life jacket with minimal submersion. He was quickly pulled out of the water by his friends with significant blood loss on scene. EMS applied combat application tourniquet to leg on scene 45 minutes ago. Pelvic binder applied, spine stabilized, and IV established in Rt AC with 1L NS infused. TXA 2 gm given and methoxyfluorane for pain control enroute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>25 year old male is involved in a boating accident. He was in the lake waterskiing and struck by another boat, sustaining blunt abdominal and pelvic injuries and significant propeller injuries to his leg.  The trauma team will be activated and he will be brought to the ED. Treatment includes tourniquet application to the limb and rapid blood product administration. Intubation for clinical course and pain management need to be addressed with disposition to the operating room.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a

Patients under the care of the critical care team may develop delayed complications of their illness or injuries. These cases can help individuals and teams prepare to identify and manage these patients who become newly, and sometimes unexpectedly, unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case comes from Dr. Dominique Piquette, academic Intensivist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Ontario with updates from Dr. Sameer Sharif (Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr. Ailish Valeriano (Emergency Medicine Resident, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Post-extubation respiratory failure occurs in up to 10% of extubations and can be caused by inability to ventilate spontaneously or by inability to tolerate removal of ETT. Causes of extubation failure include upper airway obstruction and secretions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Re-intubation is a fraught procedure, especially for trainees. They must strike the right balance between assertiveness and collaboration with the bedside team. Developing an airway plan requires consideration of anatomic and physiologic changes that have taken place since the initial intubation. Medical options are limited. The ability to communicate plan and organize resources in a timely manner is essential to a successful re-intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 59-year old man in your ICU was just extubated 30 minutes ago. He is four days post blunt polytrauma and has ongoing agitation but no other requirement for intubation. Since extubation, he has required several sedatives and has now developed stridor at rest. The nurse and respiratory therapist at the bedside are advocating for calling the staff intensivist for immediate re-intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 59-year old man was the intoxicated driver in a single car MVC. He was intubated and admitted to ICU with brain and bony injuries. The patient has been agitated and delirious throughout his stay. The decision is made to extubate. However, the patient is quite agitated and requires sedation by nursing staff.  Following extubation, he becomes stridorous and develops progressive respiratory failure. The team will need to manage the patient’s airway, eventually requiring re-intubation. Subsequently, the patient’s spouse will need to be informed of the patient’s status as well as the indications for re-intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-b06ab836-ea0a-4fd2-a82a-5e1290f135aa\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/crit-care-4-post-extubation-stridor.docx\">Crit Care 4- Post-extubation Stridor</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/crit-care-4-post-extubation-stridor.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-b06ab836-ea0a-4fd2-a82a-5e1290f135aa\">Download</a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-6166\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2024/06/25/critical-care-4-post-extubation-stridor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-6166\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-6166\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-6166\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2024/06/25/critical-care-4-post-extubation-stridor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-6166\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-6166\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-6166-68e95970b2796\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=6166&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-6166-68e95970b2796&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-6166-68e95970b2796\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/airway-edema/\" rel=\"tag\">airway edema</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/critical-care/\" rel=\"tag\">Critical Care</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/intubation/\" rel=\"tag\">intubation</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

He completed his training at Carolina’s Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He has interests in simulation education and has developed the simulation education program for the new emergency medicine residency program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why It Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case highlights an uncommon, but clinically and academically important toxidrome. Organophosphate poisoning is a well-known (but rare in developed nations) toxidrome with specific antidotes available for patient treatment and survival. This case allows for its<br>recognition and treatment to be reviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 60-year old farmer presents to the ED with a runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea. He feels short of breath and dizzy. He looks so unwell that he is placed into the resuscitation bay. Initial vital sign show tachypnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. You are immediately concerned about the copious nasal and oral secretions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This elderly berry farmer, struggling with rising costs, has accidentally poisoned himself using hand-sprayed organophosphate-based pesticide. He arrived in the ED clinically unstable with symptoms of classic cholinergic toxicity. The team leader must identify the toxidrome and direct the team to early PPE use and patient decontamination.

Patients under the care of the critical care team may develop delayed complications of their illness or injuries. These cases can help individuals and teams prepare to identify and manage these patients who become newly, and sometimes unexpectedly, unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case comes from Dr. Dominique Piquette, academic Intensivist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Ontario with updates from Dr. Sameer Sharif (Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr. Sophie Ramsden (Emergency Medicine Resident, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Major trauma patients sometimes decompensate after initial resuscitation. A detailed re-examination is important as the decline can be caused by an injury that was identified or missed in the initial stabilization phase. Delayed (but still early) development of shock in a trauma patient has the same differential differential diagnosis as during the primary survey but the treating clinician needs to be vigilant to avoid early diagnostic closure based on lab and imaging results that have been completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 46-year-old woman pinned between truck and car has been resuscitated in ED and multiple injuries were identified, including bilateral rib fractures with flail chest, liver laceration and unstable T5-6 fractures with reduction of canal diameter. ICU has admitted the patient while she awaits OR later today to stabilize the spine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 46-yearold female pedestrian struck by a truck is admitted to ICU with multiple injuries, including a thoracic spinal cord injury, a right flail chest and pneumothorax, and a liver laceration. While awaiting OR for spinal stabilization, she decompensates into mixed respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. She will require ventilatory support, escalation of vasopressors, and will develop a tension pneumothorax post-intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download Case Here</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-2437f423-a6ce-4e7a-8775-5309160f4eee\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/crit-care-3-spinal-cord-injury.docx\">Crit Care 3- Spinal cord injury</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/crit-care-3-spinal-cord-injury.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-2437f423-a6ce-4e7a-8775-5309160f4eee\">Download</a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-5538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/12/15/critical-care-3-spinal-cord-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-5538\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-5538\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-5538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/12/15/critical-care-3-spinal-cord-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-5538\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-5538\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-5538-68e9597491bf5\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=5538&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-5538-68e9597491bf5&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-5538-68e9597491bf5\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/icu-team/\" rel=\"tag\">icu team</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/respiratory-failure/\" rel=\"tag\">respiratory failure</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/trauma-2/\" rel=\"tag\">trauma</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Dr Larissa Hattin is a staff Emergency physician in Victoria, BC, Clinical Instructor at UBC and Simulation Director for the Victoria EM Residency Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why It Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Intentional overdoses are common and require close attention to both the physical and mental health care of the patient. Mental health crises often complicate treatment and providers must be aware of their obligations and limitations of mental health laws in their jurisdiction. While many places require physicians to hold patients involuntarily for mental health assessment, compelling specific medical treatments involuntarily is much more fraught.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 25-year old man presents to the emergency department after intentionally ingesting a significant amount of acetaminophen. He says that he was trying to kill himself and remains irritable and resistant to treatment. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, it is clear that the patient has taken an intentional overdose in an attempt to die but the physician must recognize both the physical and mental health aspects of the case and balance treating both while considering the legal and ethical aspects of involuntary medical care.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-3475a574-9b53-490c-998e-e4463c879145\"

Especially with climate change, certain areas in North America have been seeing record breaking cases of heat related illness.  It is critical to recognize both exertional and classic heatstroke, as they have different presentations and affect different populations. Depending on your institution’s capabilities, different therapies can be offered for heat related illness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>58 y/o M presents with hyperthermia and confusion, and was found by bystanders to be acting strange.

Chris Ding, Jane Kim, Jessica Stetz, and Sigrid Wolfram of SUNY Downstate/Kings County Hospital Centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Ding completed emergency medicine residency at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY. He is an avid proponent of simulation education and is completing a Simulation Fellowship at the University of Chicago-NorthShore University Health System. His interests include low resource EM simulation, medical device education, 3D printing, and task trainer development. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>LVADs are an increasingly common treatment modality for severe heart failure, whether as bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy. While many LVAD patients are followed at tertiary care centers with dedicated LVAD teams, ED physicians may play a key role in the detection and treatment of complications from these devices regardless of practice setting. One of the most feared complications is pump thrombosis, which can have a wide range of presenting symptoms and degrees of severity. This case aims to increase awareness of this condition among ED residents and familiarize them with the initial assessment of patients with potential complications from LVADs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>70 y/o male with CHF, an ICD, and an LVAD presents with 3 days of shortness of breath on exertion and bilateral leg swelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 70 y/o male post LVAD implantation presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of the breath. The team will need to progress through the initial assessment of an LVAD patient, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of pump thrombosis. They will initiate anticoagulation, consult cardiothoracic surgery, and admit to CTICU. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-d96da4bb-2714-48cc-a3e4-e482c5e7b94d\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lvad-pump-thrombosis.docx\">lvad-pump-thrombosis</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lvad-pump-thrombosis.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-d96da4bb-2714-48cc-a3e4-e482c5e7b94d\">Download</a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-5252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/08/17/lvad-pump-thrombosis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-5252\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-5252\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-5252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/08/17/lvad-pump-thrombosis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-5252\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-5252\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-5252-68e9597c7e324\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=5252&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-5252-68e9597c7e324&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-5252-68e9597c7e324\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/cardiology/\" rel=\"tag\">Cardiology</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/cardiothoracic-surgery/\" rel=\"tag\">cardiothoracic surgery</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/left-ventricular-assist-device-lvad/\" rel=\"tag\">Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/pump-thrombosis/\" rel=\"tag\">pump thrombosis</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Jessica Pelletier and Anne Ickes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica Pelletier, DO is an Emergency Medicine Education Fellow at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Her interests include harm reduction, the use of simulation for difficult conversations and procedural preparedness, and the use of osteopathic manipulation for pain control in the emergency department. Dr. Pelletier enjoys emergency medicine podcasts and hopes to contribute to the Free Open Access Meducation (FOAMed) literature through podcasting. She plans to pursue a career in residency leadership with a focus in resident education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Ickes, DO is currently an Addiction Fellow at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. She completed her Emergency Medicine Residency at Carilion as well. She is interested in treating opioid and alcohol use disorders to decrease Emergency Medicine visits and harmful adverse outcomes related to substance use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alcohol use disorder is markedly prevalent among patients presenting to the ED, but we often fail to recognize it or provide patients with appropriate resources for referral. The first case aims to equip emergency medicine residents to identify and manage patients presenting with complications of alcohol use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second case addresses the important concept of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) for opioid use disorder. Recognition of opioid withdrawal and prompt offering of OAT to patients who will benefit can be life saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 29-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) after falling in the shower while intoxicated. He lost consciousness and does not remember the nature of the events that brought him to the ED.

Taking decisive action and escalating therapy, including adjuncts, can be life saving and prevent intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pregnant patients have a number of physiologic changes that effect asthma including baseline hyperventilation and reduced diaphragmatic excursion secondary to the gravid uterus. This cases provides an opportunity to review these differences and mitigate them in a critically ill asthma patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>30 y/o F G1P0 at 35 weeks GA presents with shortness of breath increasing over the last few days.

Katie Maguire and Nicole Holm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Maguire is a PGY5 Emergency Medicine resident at the University of British Columbia.  Her interests include medical education, disaster medicine and simulation. She is particularly interested in simulation as an educational technique to develop communication and crisis resource management skills. She completed her undergraduate degree at Queen’s University and her medical degree at the University of Manitoba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Holm is an emergency physician in Vancouver and Squamish. She completed her residency at UBC and her simulation fellowship at the Centre for Excellence in Simulation Education and Innovation in Vancouver.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year as the weather warms and more people take advantage of water sports and outdoor activities there is increased risk of drowning. When it comes to pediatric drowning, prevention is the best medicine. However, if you find yourself treating a drowning patient in the ED, this case will have you well prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3-year-old female previously healthy presents post-submersion in a backyard pool with respiratory distress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A three-year-old child was swimming with their family, when they wandered into the deep end and submerged under water. The parents noticed the child was below the surface. When the child was brought to the surface, they were unconscious and coughing up foam. EHS arrived, provided oxygen supplementation, and brought them to your tertiary emergency department, with access to PICU. In the ED, the child is unconscious with increasing respiratory distress, requiring intubation. Despite intubation, the child remains hypoxemic and the team works through an approach to post-intubation hypoxemia. Unfortunately, the child becomes bradycardic. The team should begin CPR and follow the PALS pediatric bradycardia algorithm. PICU should be called if not already involved. After one round of CPR, the patient’s heart rate will increase and the consulting team should arrive.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-2167f3ac-94b6-453f-b71e-0a852e6d1f27\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peds-submersion.docx\"><strong>Pediatric Drowning</strong></a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peds-submersion.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-2167f3ac-94b6-453f-b71e-0a852e6d1f27\">Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"5210\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/05/09/pediatric-drowning/cxr-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png\" data-orig-size=\"788,732\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cxr\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=700\" width=\"788\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=788\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5210\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png 788w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=150 150w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=300 300w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cxr.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hon, K. , So, K. , Wong, W. , Cheung, H. &amp;

Patients under the care of the critical care team may develop delayed complications of their illness or injuries. These cases can help individuals and teams prepare to identify and manage these patients who become newly, and sometimes unexpectedly, unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case comes from Dr. Dominique Piquette, academic Intensivist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Ontario with updates from Dr. Sameer Sharif (Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr. Sophie Ramsden  (Emergency Medicine Resident, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients admitted to a medical or surgical ward may decompensate, overwhelming the resources available. Most hospitals have a critical care outreach or rapid response team that can be activated in these cases. The critical care team must quickly assess the patient and carefully consider how to provide critical care safely and expediciously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the team must rapidly identify the respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular weakness and then develop an intubation plan that accounts for the anatomically difficult airway created by the mediastinal mass. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 57-year-old female with history of thymoma and myasthenia gravis is currently admitted to a general medical ward for pneumonia develops respiratory distress 48 hours after admission. A respiratory therapist (RT) was paged to assess the patient and then called you urgently because the patient appears unwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>57-year-old female with known history of myasthenia gravis and thymoma is admitted to hospital 48 hours prior for CAP and started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. Over the last 24 hours, she has developed progressive weakness and bulbar symptoms. RT was paged to assess vital capacity, and finds her in respiratory distress, at which point the Rapid Response Team (sim team) is paged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resuscitation team is expected to recognize and manage myasthenic crisis with respiratory failure, with consideration for airway management with an anterior mediastinal mass. The patient will require intubation and pharmacotherapy for myasthenic crisis. Additionally, the team is expected to update the family member, and inform them of medical error.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download Case Here:</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/crit-care-2-myasthenic-crisis.docx\">Download Case</a></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-5163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/02/15/critical-care-2-myasthenic-crisis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-5163\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-5163\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-5163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/02/15/critical-care-2-myasthenic-crisis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-5163\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-5163\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-5163-68e95988e98a6\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=5163&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-5163-68e95988e98a6&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-5163-68e95988e98a6\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/difficult-airway/\" rel=\"tag\">difficult airway</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/intubation/\" rel=\"tag\">intubation</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/respiratory-failure/\" rel=\"tag\">respiratory failure</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/ward-decompensation/\" rel=\"tag\">ward decompensation</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

He completed a fellowship in simulation through the U of O Skills and Simulation Centre. His academic interests are in education, simulation, and translational simulation; including where simulation can improve hospital and emergency department preparedness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We recognized a gap in the opportunities and cases available for residents to work through penetrating extremity trauma algorithms acutely. This case highlights the importance of a thorough and systematic ATLS assessment identifying both life <em>and </em>limb threatening injuries. It also opens a discussion on penetrating extremity trauma algorithms (e.g., WEST algorithm) and recognizing hard vascular signs to impact management acutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple gunshot wounds. “Minding my own business” downtown. Dropped off by car at emergency doors, drop and run. Patient intoxicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adult male with penetrating extremity and chest trauma (gun shot wounds) with peripheral vascular compromise. The patient needs a thorough and systematic approach despite distracting injuries. For both junior and senior learners, the patient progresses from threatened limb (requiring emergent investigation) to a pulseless limb (requiring emergent OR). For senior learners, there will be an additional element of instability from the penetrating chest injury requiring chest tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD CASE HERE</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-3690c316-bd31-4ad0-a14b-8776bf53411e\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gsw-vascular-injury.docx\">GSW Vascular Injury</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gsw-vascular-injury.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-3690c316-bd31-4ad0-a14b-8776bf53411e\">Download</a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-5148\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/01/10/gsw-vascular-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-5148\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-5148\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-5148\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2023/01/10/gsw-vascular-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-5148\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-5148\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-5148-68e9598a823f8\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=5148&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-5148-68e9598a823f8&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-5148-68e9598a823f8\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/gsw/\" rel=\"tag\">GSW</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/hemorrhage/\" rel=\"tag\">hemorrhage</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/penetrating/\" rel=\"tag\">penetrating</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/trauma-2/\" rel=\"tag\">trauma</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Patients under the care of the critical care team may develop delayed complications of their illness or injuries. These cases can help individuals and teams prepare to identify and manage these patients who become newly, and sometimes unexpectedly, unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case comes from Dr. Dominique Piquette, academic Intensivist at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Ontario with updates from Dr. Sameer Sharif (Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario) and Dr. Ailish Valeriano (Emergency Medicine Resident, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients with critical brain injuries may decompensate at any time. Close vigilance is required as a decline in mental status may be subtle at time. Complications of brain injuries must be treated quickly as damage can be rapid and irreversible. In addition, these patients are rarely cared for by an individual and require clear and effective team communication to maintain a shared mental model. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EMS has brought a direct transfer to Neurosurgery from surrounding hospital for SAH. The patient had severe headache for 5 days and was initially treated by GP as migraine. Today, she developed new confusion today and was taken to the local emergency department where a CT scan showed “SAH with hydrocephalus”. Patient has a GCS of 14 prior to transfer but her neurologic status declined during transfer – GCS 11 on arrival.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A previously healthy 46-year old woman is transferred from a surrounding hospital with CT-confirmed diagnosis of SAH with hydrocephalus. The patient is transferred direct to Neurosurgery and booked for OR but experiences progressive decreases in her GCS while awaiting surgery. She is admitted to ICU by the junior resident who attempts management and calls for the fellow. When the ICU fellow arrives, the patient’s GCS is 5 and she then becomes hypotensive and desaturates. The ICU team must secure the airway, manage the blood pressure, and coordinate care with Neurosurgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download Case Here</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-5cc8f57b-fd4c-4678-acff-6d623e5a0ff3\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/crit-care-1-sah.docx\">Critical Care Case 1- Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/crit-care-1-sah.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-5cc8f57b-fd4c-4678-acff-6d623e5a0ff3\">Download</a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-5118\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2022/12/13/critical-care-1-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-5118\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-5118\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-5118\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2022/12/13/critical-care-1-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-5118\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-5118\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-5118-68e9598d17f43\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=5118&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-5118-68e9598d17f43&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-5118-68e9598d17f43\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/altered-loc/\" rel=\"tag\">Altered LOC</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/communication/\" rel=\"tag\">Communication</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/critical-care/\" rel=\"tag\">Critical Care</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/intracranial-hemorrhage/\" rel=\"tag\">intracranial hemorrhage</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Since leaving the military, Dr. Koo works as an Emergency Physician and Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at MedStar Health and Georgetown University. He previously served as Deputy Medical Director at Andersen Simulation Center, the largest simulation center in the US Army as well as the Simulation Director for Madigan Army Medical Center’s Department of Emergency Medicine Residency. He has experience using simulation to train combat medics, resistive team dynamics, and emergency medicine residents alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Massive hemoptysis is a seldom-encountered, but potentially life-threatening airway crisis. Emergency medicine learners must be able to quickly recognize this presentation while learning manage the airway effectively. The nuances of positioning and selective intubation are not encountered often and this simulation gives learners the opportunity to practice and work through the team dynamics and intubation technique within a safe environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Per EMS Report: Patient called 911 complaining of breathlessness and cough, progressively worsening over the last three days. The patient is coming from home, where he was found sitting in his couch in mild respiratory distress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a case of a 57-year-old male with former smoking history, COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation coming into a community emergency department (ED) with symptoms consistent with COPD exacerbation. His initial presentation will respond to traditional therapies for COPD exacerbation. During his ED stay, however, the patient will develop a coughing fit and hemoptysis with airway compromise, requiring learners to secure the airway, reverse anticoagulation, and manage massive hemoptysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download Case Here</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-5cc8f57b-fd4c-4678-acff-6d623e5a0ff3\"

Stephen Jensen, Brandon Bowdoin, and Kristen Whitworth as well as Spring Lutzen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen Jensen is a third-year emergency medicine resident at Spectrum Health Lakeland. He is completing a longitudinal track in Medical Education during his residency with a focus in simulation and curriculum development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brandon Bowdoin is the Chief Resident at Spectrum Health Lakeland. He is completing a longitudinal track in Medical Education during his residency with a focus on podcasting and on shift teaching and evaluation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kristen Whitworth is an emergency medicine physician and the Simulation Director for the Spectrum Health Lakeland Simulation Training Center. She completed a Medical Education longitudinal track during her residency with a focus on simulation and educational design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring Lutzen is the manager of the Spectrum Health Lakeland Simulation Training Center. She is a Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator through the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and has many years of clinical experience as a respiratory therapist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-it-matters\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rapid evaluation and treatment of patients is a vital skill required of emergency medicine physicians. EM physicians are required to task switch numerous times, often assessing a new patient immediately after critical interventions have been implemented on their current patient. The skill of task switching is not often evaluated with simulation as cases are often a single patient encounter. This multi-case simulation reproduces a series of critical patient presentations encountered on a busy shift. This multi-case was created to provide formative feedback regarding the senior residents’ ability function with a heavy cognitive load while transitioning between critical patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-summary\">CASE SUMMARies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a multi-case simulation.  The initial patient will present with a STEMI. The resident will need to arrange for cardiac catheterization and provide appropriate medical treatment. The exact moment these orders are completed, a stroke activation will be called for a patient eligible for tPA.  Stroke protocol needs to be followed and tPA will need to be given. As soon as tPA is pushed, the resident will be handed an EKG with signs of hyperkalemia and told that a patient with depression has checked in. The resident will need to immediately evaluate the patient with hyperkalemia and give appropriate medications or they will decline. As they are pushing the medications, a Trauma Level One will be called. The trauma will be an open book pelvic fracture with hypotension and a positive FAST. The patient will need a pelvic binder, blood products, and go immediately to the OR. At this time, the resident will need to follow up on the stroke and hyperkalemia patients before evaluating the patient presenting with depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"

Bronchiolitis is no exception. These patients can be quite sick and yet the evidence for many proposed therapeutic interventions leaves a lot to be desired. Is epinephrine helpful, can salbutamol be attempted? What if there is a family history of asthma? Jump into this sim case to learn more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clinical-vignette\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent viral illness. This AM, breathing sounded “noisy,” so parents called 811 (telehealth nurse assessment service). Sent to the ED.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-summary\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Four days ago, an older sibling who recently started pre-school had a cold. The next day, 6-month-old Zarah fell sick. She has had a runny nose and cough but seemed to be doing fine until yesterday when she did not eat or drink very much. This morning, she had some noisy breathing, and her chest looked funny while she was breathing. When it did not go away after a couple of hours, Zarah’s parents called 811 for advice. They were directed to go to the emergency department. The patient will progress through escalating respiratory support and eventually require intubation and transfer to higher level of care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"

Melissa Bouwsema, Tia Warkentin and Erin Brennan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drs Bouwsema and Warkentin are Emergency Medicine Residents at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Dr. Brennan is an attending Emergency Physician at Kingston General Hospital and Emergency Medicine Residency Program Director at Queen’s University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about this case in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s43678-023-00474-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine: Education Innovation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why It Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case aims to address microaggressions using simulation. Microaggressions are defined as daily, subtle snubs, slights, and insults directed towards historically stigmatized, oppressed or excluded groups that implicitly communicate hostility, general disrespect and devaluation. This case focusses specifically on microaggressions women commonly experience as health care providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 60-year old man comes to the ED from home with two days of confusion and urinary symptoms. He is febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive on arrival to the resusciation bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The resident team leader has 3 minutes to organize her team. She has 2 male RNs available. As the case progresses, she will encounter multiple gendered microaggressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A paramedic goes to a male nurse asks if he is the staff taking care of this patient (gender stereotype 1). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the resuscitation begins, the mildly confused patient comments on the resident’s appearance “lucky me to get such a good-looking doctor” (gender stereotype 2). Once the patient is more settled, he asks the resident for warm blankets and ginger ale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patient is stabilized and the resident contacts the internist on call. The consultant comes down and asks “who is in charge of this patient”. He begins questioning the management and asks to speak to the staff (gender stereotype 3).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Debriefing Notes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case, in many ways, serves as a launching point for conversation. <strong>It is not a traditional simulation case</strong>; instead of having the debriefing and discussion concentrate on medical management and individual participants’ actions, facilitators intentionally describe the microaggressions that occurred and guide the discussion to focus on concrete actions that can be integrated into clinical practice.  The case involves many actors. The role of the actors is essentially to commit the microaggressions toward the resident managing the case. <strong>Because this case can be triggering, especially for individuals having experienced previous microaggressions, careful selection of actors and participants, as well as pre-briefing the resident leading the case far ahead of time are crucial.</strong> When we ran this case with our residents, one of the case authors volunteered ahead of time to be the resident managing the case. This means she was aware beforehand that she would be having this experience. The other trainees watched the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that simulation is a useful tool; it’s impact and utility depend on who is using it and how well they know how to operate it. This is particularly true for this case. In addition to normal pre-briefing information about safe spaces, this case requires the explicit discussion of brave spaces. <strong>It also requires that the facilitators have taken the time to learn about microaggressions and their impact.</strong> For this session to have positive impact, the facilitators must also be versed in discussing ways that we can be allies to those experiencing microaggressions. The real value here is in educating each other through conversation. <strong>A skilled facilitator is required to ensure biases are not perpetuated.</strong> We would also recommend that the facilitators should be of diverse background – both those who have experienced microaggression (in this case, those identifying as cisgender women) and those who have not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the Case Here</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-7183e7ad-9be3-4264-93d9-f58bfdf58b5d\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/allyship-case.docx\">Allyship: Gendered Microaggressions Case</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/allyship-case.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-7183e7ad-9be3-4264-93d9-f58bfdf58b5d\">Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Learning Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about microaggressions and their impact on health care professionals, we recommend reading <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34611780/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">this article by Samina Ali</span></a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456801/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">this fantastic review article from Annals of Emergency Medicine</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking to learn more about how to be an ally or how to respond when witnessing microaggressions, we would recommend resources such as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31365391/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">O3</span></a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456801/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Open the Front Door</span></a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.racialequityvtnea.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Interrupting-Bias_-Calling-Out-vs.-Calling-In-REVISED-Aug-2018-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">the 5 D’s or Call In/Call Out</span></a>. <strong>These resources are a bare minimum for facilitators looking to incorporate a session like this one into their curriculum.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Torres MB, Salles A, Cochran A.

This case will allow learners to recognize the rhythm, explore different treatment options, and deal with the side effects or progression of the disease. It is also a good case to practice communication with the team and effective decision making. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clinical-vignette\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>37F with 3 hour history of palpitations.

The case and debrief can explore important topics such as recognition of futility in resuscitation, having the participant commit to and own a decision for termination, and explore the impacts related with that decision. Impacts may include discussion on the emotional impacts of death, physician wellness, and the physician role in terminating resuscitation. For senior learners, scaffolding breaking bad news or a hot debrief with their team can take the topic even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clinical-vignette\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of hospital cardiac arrest. EMS called for chest pain. Patient collapsed on EMS arrival, witnessed arrest, CPR started. Total transport time 30 minutes. Shock x1 for ventricular fibrillation. Now in asystole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-summary\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The medical aspect of this case is a relatively straight-forward out-of-hospital cardiac arrest where the team must recognize futility and make the decision to stop resuscitation efforts. The primary goal is simulating the experience of making a termination of resuscitation decision, and managing the impacts of a patient’s death. Other goals could also be scaffolded onto this scenario as deemed appropriate by the simulation instructor, including breaking bad news to family member or a simulated hot debrief with the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-case-here\">DOWNLOAD CASE HERE</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a

Dan Howes and Mike O’Connor. The course emerged organically in response to requests from first year residents wanting more training in the response to acutely unwell patients. In 2014, Dr. Tim Chaplin took over as the course director and has expanded the course to include first year residents from 14 programs and to provide both formative feedback and summative assessment. The course involves 4 sessions between August and November and a summative OSCE in December. Each session involves 4-5 residents and covers 3 simulated scenarios that are based on common calls to the floor. The course has been adapted for use at the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, and the University of Calgary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-it-matters\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few months of residency can be a stressful time with long nights on call and the adjustment to a new level of responsibility. While help should always be available, the first few minutes of managing a decompensating patient is something all junior residents must be competent at. This case series will help to accomplish that through simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clinical-vignette\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is 3:00 am, you are called to the floor to assess a 73-year old man, Mr. Brown, who was admitted to general surgery 2 days ago, and has a scheduled large bowel resection for diverticulitis tomorrow.  He has been undergoing bowel prep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are called because he is experiencing confusion, shortness of breath, and chest heaviness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-summary\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case involves the assessment and management of an acutely confused patient with hypertensive encephalopathy. The resident is expected to initiate appropriate supportive measures (ensure working IV, oxygen, monitors) while obtaining a focused history and performing a focused physical exam, including a detailed neurologic assessment. They should recognize the elevated blood pressure and order a work-up for end-organ damage. The patient will require transfer to a critical care setting for administration of acute blood pressure lowering agents including involvement of RACE or a similar high acuity response team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-here-nightmares-12-htn-encephalopathy\">DOWNLOAD HERE – <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/nm12-htn-encephalopathy.docx\">NIGHTMARES 12: HTN Encephalopathy</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ekg-for-the-case\">EKG FOR THE CASE</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://litfl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/normal-sinus-rhythm-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://litfl.com/normal-sinus-rhythm-ecg-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Life in the Fast Lane MedEd Blog</a></figcaption></figure>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/12/07/nightmares-case-12-hypertensive-encephalopathy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4929\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4929\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/12/07/nightmares-case-12-hypertensive-encephalopathy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4929\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4929\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4929-68e9599b71ba6\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4929&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4929-68e9599b71ba6&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4929-68e9599b71ba6\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/confusion/\" rel=\"tag\">confusion</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/hypertension/\" rel=\"tag\">hypertension</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/nightmares/\" rel=\"tag\">nightmares</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

He is out for a trail run when he becomes trapped in waist deep cold water. When he is found by search and rescue, he is awake with altered mental status. He has a cardiac arrest on retrieval and is found to be severely hypothermic. CPR and ACLS is initiated and he is transferred to the nearest community ED. The resuscitation team is expected to perform ACLS specific to hypothermic arrest. The patient will require intubation, active rewarming, defibrillation and discussion with the ECMO physician on call for transport and ECMO assisted rewarming.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3

Dan Howes and Mike O’Connor. The course emerged organically in response to requests from first year residents wanting more training in the response to acutely unwell patients. In 2014, Dr. Tim Chaplin took over as the course director and has expanded the course to include first year residents from 14 programs and to provide both formative feedback and summative assessment. The course involves 4 sessions between August and November and a summative OSCE in December. Each session involves 4-5 residents and covers 3 simulated scenarios that are based on common calls to the floor. The course has been adapted for use at the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, and the University of Calgary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-it-matters\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few months of residency can be a stressful time with long nights on call and the adjustment to a new level of responsibility. While help should always be available, the first few minutes of managing a decompensating patient is something all junior residents must be competent at. This case series will help to accomplish that through simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clinical-vignette\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 23:00 and you’re called to assess a 42-year old man who has been admitted to the orthopedics service for a right tibial osteomyelitis. He has had an initial debridement and is awaiting a second surgery in 48 hours.

Nicole Durfey and Kyle Santee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Durfey is an emergency physician at Kent Hospital and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine.  She has a special interest in simulation and resuscitation and is the Critical Care Director for Kent Hospital’s Emergency Medicine Residency Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Santee is a third year emergency medicine resident at Kent Hospital. He has an interest in critical care medicine, including resuscitation and difficult airway management. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracheostomy emergencies are high acuity, low occurrence situations.  Lack of experience with tracheostomy patients can be anxiety provoking for many emergency physicians.  Simulation allows for the practice of an algorithmic approach to the tracheostomy patient with airway compromise.  This case provides both cognitive practice for the identification and treatment of the most common causes of acute decompensation (obstruction and displacement), as well as procedural familiarity with tracheostomy tubes and stoma intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EMS called by wife after sudden onset respiratory distress.  Just released from rehab yesterday from severe motor vehicle collision 2 months ago.  Tracheostomy in place.  Sudden onset severe respiratory distress, hypoxic at 80% on a 100% NRB.  ETA 5 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>48-year-old male with a recent tracheostomy presents with sudden onset respiratory distress.  The patient is unable to be oxygenated or ventilated through the tracheostomy tube. The team must recognize that the tracheostomy tube is either obstructed or displaced.  Attempts to correct tracheostomy obstruction with suctioning and cuff deflation are not successful.  Removal of the tracheostomy tube is required, followed by either oral intubation or placement of a new tracheostomy tube. The patient improves once oral or stomal intubation is performed. If tracheostomy tube is not removed, the patient worsens and goes into cardiac arrest secondary to respiratory failure. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE: </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-67db71f0-0f2a-41b8-8f98-1092baa25bef\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tracheal-obstruction-1.docx\">Tracheostomy Emergency</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tracheal-obstruction-1.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-67db71f0-0f2a-41b8-8f98-1092baa25bef\">Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/10/26/trach-emergency/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4917\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4917\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/10/26/trach-emergency/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4917\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4917\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4917-68e959a16c6a1\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4917&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4917-68e959a16c6a1&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4917-68e959a16c6a1\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/airway/\" rel=\"tag\">Airway</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/intubation/\" rel=\"tag\">intubation</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/resuscitation-2/\" rel=\"tag\">resuscitation</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/tracheostomy/\" rel=\"tag\">Tracheostomy</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

It’s not surprising that a sick trauma patient can get your heart rate up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But emergency physicians have all the skills needed to safely handle any trauma airway!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ATLS revolutionized trauma care via a series of standard surveys (primary, secondary and tertiary) and given emergency providers tools to adopt a shared mental model. However, it has become overly prescriptive and can inhibit emergency physicians from activating their usual resuscitative skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we view the Primary Survey (A-B-C-D-E) as a tool to assess the trauma patient and not as a rigid step-by-step treatment plan, ER docs can approach a trauma intubation like every other intubation and adequately resuscitate before they intubate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">-=-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My approach to intubation in the severely injured patient:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Use A-B-C-D-E to <em>assess </em>the traumatized patient in less than one minute</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Identify the need for intubation and anatomic and physiologic challenges</li><li>Logroll can usually be deferred until intubation is complete</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Resuscitate before you intubation. Identify causes of shock that will cause decompensation during rapid-sequence intubation. Correct these<em> in order of physiologic priority,</em> not in A-B-C-D-E order.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Causes of shock in traumatized patients</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Obstructive: pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax</li><li>Hypovolemic: internal or external hemorrhage</li><li>Distributive: neurogenic shock (diagnosis of exclusion)</li><li>Medical: intoxication/withdrawal, medication-related, underlying medical issue (based on history)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Develop and vocalize a <em>multi-step airway plan</em>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Expect an anatomically difficult airway</li><li>Tailor medications to your specific patient</li><li>Prepare adjuncts and back-up plans</li><li>Prepare for surgical airway (at minimum, mental rehearsal)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">-=-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are three sim cases based on patients that I cared for over the past year working as a Trauma Team Leader in Hamilton, Ontario. They each provide a different challenge to airway management of the trauma patient. They can be used in the ED or sim lab and are appropriate for both Trauma Team quality improvement and for team dynamics optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case 1 – <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10em-trauma-case-1.docx\">Severe chest injury</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case 2 – <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10em-trauma-case-2.docx\">Facial smash</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case 3 – <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10em-trauma-case-3.docx\">Uncooperative polytrauma</a></span></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">-=-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For further reading on this topic, please see Petrosoniak &amp; Hicks’ excellent article in EM Clinics of North America (2018). <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emc.2017.08.005\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Resuscitation Resequenced: A Rational Approach to Patients with Trauma in Shock</span></a>.</p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/10/01/trauma-airway-management/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4887\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4887\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/10/01/trauma-airway-management/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4887\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4887\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4887-68e959a527366\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4887&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4887-68e959a527366&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4887-68e959a527366\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/difficult-airway/\" rel=\"tag\">difficult airway</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/shock/\" rel=\"tag\">shock</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/trauma-2/\" rel=\"tag\">trauma</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Dan Howes and Mike O’Connor. The course emerged organically in response to requests from first year residents wanting more training in the response to acutely unwell patients. In 2014, Dr. Tim Chaplin took over as the course director and has expanded the course to include first year residents from 14 programs and to provide both formative feedback and summative assessment. The course involves 4 sessions between August and November and a summative OSCE in December. Each session involves 4-5 residents and covers 3 simulated scenarios that are based on common calls to the floor. The course has been adapted for use at the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, and the University of Calgary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few months of residency can be a stressful time with long nights on call and the adjustment to a new level of responsibility. While help should always be available, the first few minutes of managing a decompensating patient is something all junior residents must be competent at. This case series will help to accomplish that through simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 9:00 pm and you have been called to assess a patient who has developed a rash and nausea shortly after starting an IV dose of pip/tazo. On handover you were told the patient was a clinically stable 68-year old man who was admitted this morning for treatment of a diabetic foot infection that has been progressing despite oral antibiotics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this scenario, the learner is called to the ward to assess a 68-year old male with new rash and dizziness. When assessed, the patient will be tachycardic and hypotensive. He will develop progressive signs of anaphylaxis including urticaria, wheeze, throat tightness and, finally, lip swelling. The learner needs to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis, call for help and treat with appropriate doses of epinephrine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD HERE – <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nm10-anaphylaxis.docx\">Nightmares 10: Anaphylaxis</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No EKGs or Imaging FOR THE CASE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/09/14/nightmares-case-10-anaphylaxis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4873\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4873\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/09/14/nightmares-case-10-anaphylaxis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4873\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4873\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4873-68e959a6dbccd\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4873&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4873-68e959a6dbccd&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4873-68e959a6dbccd\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/allergy/\" rel=\"tag\">allergy</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/anaphylaxis/\" rel=\"tag\">anaphylaxis</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/nightmares/\" rel=\"tag\">nightmares</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

This is the ninth case in a series we are publishing that make up “The Nightmares Course” – a Sim Bootcamp for new residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nightmares Course at Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario) was developed in 2011 by Drs. Dan Howes and Mike O’Connor. The course emerged organically in response to requests from first year residents wanting more training in the response to acutely unwell patients. In 2014, Dr. Tim Chaplin took over as the course director and has expanded the course to include first year residents from 14 programs and to provide both formative feedback and summative assessment. The course involves 4 sessions between August and November and a summative OSCE in December. Each session involves 4-5 residents and covers 3 simulated scenarios that are based on common calls to the floor. The course has been adapted for use at the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba, and the University of Calgary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first few months of residency can be a stressful time with long nights on call and the adjustment to a new level of responsibility. While help should always be available, the first few minutes of managing a decompensating patient is something all junior residents must be competent at. This case series will help to accomplish that through simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 5:00 am and you’ve been called to see a patient complaining of “chest discomfort”. This is a 64-year old man who is admitted to the floor with pneumonia and was transitioned to oral antibiotics yesterday. The chest discomfort started at 4:40 and didn’t respond to the patient’s regular antacid medication. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this scenario, the learner is called to the ward to assess a 64-year old male with new chest pain. The learner must order an EKG and recognize a ST-elevation myocardial infarction. They must then give appropriate medication and activate the interventional cardiology team. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD HERE – <a

Rosamaria North and George McKay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. North is an ER physician and Simulation Director for Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre ER Dept. She completed her training with the Northern Ontario School of Medicine in Thunder Bay (family med and emergency medicine). Dr. McKay also completed all of his training at NOSM. They both love to facilitate simulations for learners and their ED group to learn from making their worst nightmares come to life. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is important because it highlights a rare cause of cardiac arrest where the patient presents with several risk factors that could be identified as the clues to the obstructive respiratory pathology. It also highlights the need to move to an advanced airway when BVM is ineffective during cardiac arrest. Lastly, it’s also is an opportunity to practice troubleshooting a FB in the airway which can be really stressful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EMS handover (advanced care crew): The patient was apparently eating dinner with family. They witnessed the patient collapse and started CPR. The initial rhythm was PEA and the patient has remained in PEA. We’ve inserted an IV and given 3 doses of epinephrine. There is an OP airway in place but the patient is difficult to bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This case involves a 60-year-old male patient who arrives VSA in PEA after collapsing while eating dinner with family. The collateral history included that he was suspected to be intoxicated. The patient is difficult to bag with EMS. The learner will have to work through the can’t ventilate/can’t oxygenate scenario once they identify that BVM is ineffective. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE

Diana De Santis, Jennifer Ann Klowak and Quang Ngo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. De Santis is a 3rd year pediatric resident at McMaster University, Waterloo Regional Campus. She has an interest in medical education and simulation and hopes to pursue a career in general pediatrics in the community setting. Dr. Klowak is a pediatrician and clinician investigator. She is currently completing a fellowship in pediatric intensive care at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Dr. Ngo is an Associate Professor and clinician educator in the Department of Pediatrics at McMaster University and a practicing pediatric emergency medicine physician at McMaster Children’s Hospital. His educational and scholarly interests are in simulation-based education and assessment and feedback.  He currently serves as the founding program director for the Pediatric Emergency Medicine subspecialty residency program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most pediatric head injuries do not result in significant traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, this case highlights the importance of early recognition of severe pediatric TBI and aggressive management of increased ICP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case takes place in a community hospital setting with limited clinical personnel and therefore allows the team to work through patient stabilization without direct support (i.e. using virtual/telephone communication with pediatric critical care) as well as coordination of disposition. The case also highlights the importance of considering non-accidental injury as a potential etiology of TBI, specifically in cases of unwitnessed traumatic injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An 18-month old previously well child presents to the emergency department of a community hospital with a head injury following an unwitnessed fall from significant height on a play structure with initial loss of consciousness. He is awake but irritable in the trauma bay, with obvious head injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An 18-month old boy presents to a community ED following an unwitnessed fall from significant height. He is initially irritable with GCS of 11 but quickly develops signs of increased ICP and herniation (secondary to an epidural hematoma). He will require acute management of increased ICP, intubation and adherence to neuroprotective measures. After stabilization, arrangements must be made for transfer to a tertiary care centre for neurosurgical assessment and PICU admission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the case here: <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/peds-tbi.docx\">Peds TBI</a></h3>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/06/01/pediatric-traumatic-brain-injury/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4787\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4787\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/06/01/pediatric-traumatic-brain-injury/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4787\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4787\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4787-68e959b01acac\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4787&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4787-68e959b01acac&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4787-68e959b01acac\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/head-injury/\" rel=\"tag\">head injury</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/pediatrics/\" rel=\"tag\">Pediatrics</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/trauma-2/\" rel=\"tag\">trauma</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

In addition, violence in the ED is an increasingly important topic that requires preparation ahead of incidents in order to ensure a safe outcome for all involved. This case gives a chance to practice management of an overdose patient as well as to develop and/or refine ED protocols for dealing with an armed patient including handling of a weapon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4737\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"800,1551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ed-gun-handling_54419101-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=155\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=528\" width=\"528\" height=\"1023\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=528\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4737\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=528 528w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=77 77w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=155 155w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png?w=768 768w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ed-gun-handling_54419101-1.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EMS notes state this patient was found downtown unresponsive. He was given one dose of 0.4mg IM naloxone and brought into the ED. Cap glucose 5.2 mmol/L. NRB at 15L/min applied. They also found a pool of blood around the patient and placed some gauze onto a bleeding scalp laceration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case a 44 y/o M is brought in via EMS after receiving 0.4mg of naloxone for what is suspected to be an opioid overdose. He remains GCS 7 upon arrival in the resuscitation bay. The team will need to work through the differential for altered LoC and will find drug paraphernalia and a loaded weapon on the patient upon inspection. The case will end with successful treatment and consultation with local police with regard to weapon and contraband protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE

Chris Heyd and Chad Singh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Caners is a staff emergency physician and Assistant Professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. She is an assistant director at McMaster’s Centre for Simulation-Based Learning, responsible for Patient Safety and In Situ Simulation. Dr. Heyd is a staff emergency physician and trauma team leader in Hamilton, Ontario and Simulation Director of McMaster University’s FRCP-EM program.  Dr. Singh is a PGY-3 resident in Emergency Medicine at McMaster University with a special interest in trauma and simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From a clinical perspective, gun shot wounds can cause massive internal injuries that are not always apparent from a superficial examination of a patient. This case requires learners to use the tools common to all major trauma – a structured clinical exam (such as the ATLS primary survey), close attention to vital signs and GCS and bedside imaging or x-rays and ultrasound. Major trauma requires prompt treatment including massive transfusion, adjunct medications and arranging definitive surgical management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a simulation perspective, this case has been used for nearly seven years and was ready for a re-fresh. The basic goal is to give junior learners an opportunity to manage a critically injured patient in the safety of the sim lab. In the current form, emphasis has been placed on giving early blood products over crystalloid, as well as an opportunity to discuss interval developments in the literature (like blood product ratios in massive transfusion) and to take a close look at local protocols. Cases in any sim curriculum should undergo periodic review to ensure they are relevant and up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 20-something year old unknown male is brought to your community ED in a wheelchair by friends. They were at a party and a fight broke out. It was loud and dark and then they saw the patient collapse. His low back is covered in blood. He is awake but moaning. Unknown identity/meds/allergies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 20- something year old male is dropped off at a community ED after a gunshot wound to the lower back. He will quickly be placed in a resuscitation bed and placed on monitors. His initial vitals will include tachycardia but no hypotension. The team will proceed through their primary survey and identify only one gunshot wound. If they do not recognize possible free fluid and the need for blood, the patient will become increasingly hypotensive. They will be required to intubate the patient while waiting for the staff surgeon to arrive in order for the patient to go to the OR.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the case here:

This model was recently used for the @KelownaEM annual resident procedure day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OCS is a rarely encountered clinical entity that arises after orbital trauma or as a complication of oculofacial surgery<sup>1</sup>. Its presence is suggested based on history and clinical examination which are often remarkable for recent orbital trauma or manipulation accompanied by decreased visual acuity, afferent pupillary defect, proptosis, and increased intra-ocular pressure <sup>2</sup>. The bony architecture of the orbit creates an enclosed space in which increased pressure can rapidly begin to compress vital structures such as the optic nerve, which can lead to irreversible vision loss in the affected eye. <sup></sup></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the diagnosis of OCS is made, the decision to carry out a lateral canthotomy (LC) must be made expeditiously as permanent vision loss can occur within 90-120 minutes from symptom onset<sup>3</sup>. Though the LC is a simple and potentially vision saving procedure that is in the scope of practice of emergency medicine physicians, many will have had minimal experience carrying out the procedure in clinical practice. Numerous models have been developed to train physicians in the proper technique of LC; cadaveric models provide some of the highest fidelity models available for LC but their use is limited by cadaver availability and embalmed cadaver’s globes often lose their volume, making the model low fidelity<sup>4,5</sup>. Synthetic anatomical models are more readily available, but their cost and fidelity can vary substantially. Animal models provide a happy medium in terms of cost and fidelity. Recently the UBC EM Interior residency cohort trialed the use of porcine facial models as task trainers for simulated LCs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 25 y/o M pitching in a Sunday baseball game is hit in the face by a line drive. He is brought to the ED by his friends complaining of decreased visual acuity to his right eye accompanied by significant right peri-orbital swelling. At triage his VA is OD 20/100 OS 20/25 but at the time of assessment VA OD is limited to detection of light and his pupil is fixed and dilated, extra-ocular movements are intact. The team should recognize the need for lateral canthotomy based on the history and physical exam findings (including IOP) and mobilize the appropriate resources for bed-side lateral canthotomy as well as the need for emergent ophthalmology consult.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Materials and Methods</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to carrying out the procedure in the simulation lab, learners were provided with educational resources outlining the indications for and methods of carrying out the LC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently butchered porcine heads were procured from a local processor. Each model allowed for two LC procedures to be carried out allowing for one learner to carry out bilateral LCs or for two learners to practice on the same model. To mimic the clinical findings of proptosis, chemosis, and increased intra-ocular pressure seen with retrobulbar hematoma/orbital compartment syndrome, 20mL of normal saline was instilled retro-orbitally with a 22G 1.5-inch needle via a medial approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the procedure itself each learner was provided with alcohol swabs for skin sterilization, a 10mL syringe with 27G needle for instillation of local anesthetic, a mosquito hemostat for crush hemostasis, forceps for tissue manipulation, and iris scissors for tissue dissection and cantholysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the skin overlying the lateral orbit was cleaned a small volume of local anesthetic was instilled, after which the hemostat was applied to the lateral canthus for 30-60 seconds to achieve hemostasis. After sufficient time had elapsed the hemostat was released, and the iris scissors were used to cut along the path of compression through all layers of tissue down to the level of bone with care being taken to direct instruments laterally, toward the orbital rim and away from the globe to minimize the risk of iatrogenic globe injury. Forceps were then used to retract the lower eyelid and expose the inferior crus of the lateral canthal tendon at its position just inferior and posterior to the lateral canthal fold. The location of the tendon can be confirmed by palpation, with its characteristic band-like texture belying its location. Once located, the tendon was cut with the iris scissors to decompress the orbital compartment, again taking care to avoid injury to the globe. The superior crus can be similarly located via palpation and cut should the orbital compartment require additional decompression. <sup>6,7</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4691\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/picture1-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png\" data-orig-size=\"464,624\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"picture1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png?w=223\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png?w=464\" width=\"464\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png?w=464\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4691\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png 464w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png?w=112 112w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/picture1.png?w=223 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\"></a><figcaption>Figure 1: Overview of the LC (Source: Prevention and Management of Orbital Hematoma by Ramakrishnan and Palmer, Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America, 2010)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discussion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Porcine facial models provided an excellent task trainer for LC in the simulation lab. Their orbital anatomy closely approximates that of humans and the instillation of 20mL saline into the retro-orbital space mimics the clinical presentation of OCS quite well. There are some limitations when it comes to the use of porcine facial models. The skin of the porcine model is significantly thicker than human skin and requires more force to dissect. Additionally, there are some fidelity shortcomings with the porcine model, the lack of pupillary reactivity makes it difficult to evaluate successful decompression and without active bleeding the LC site is much cleaner in the porcine model than can be expected in vivo. Despite these minor issues the porcine facial models proved to be outstanding task trainers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE: </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lateral-canthotomy-1.docx\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">Lateral Canthotomy</span></a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lateral-canthotomy-1.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download>Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" type=\"1\"><li>Gordon, S., &amp; Macrae, H.

Dr. Shani Italiya, DO is an emergency medicine physician and the medical director at the Christus Spohn Shoreline Simulation Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-eclampsia complicates between 2-10% of pregnancies and remains an important cause of maternal mortality accounting for approximately 15% of maternal deaths in the United States of America. Of those, approximate half of all cases occur during the postpartum period. Traditional education has taught learners to look for and recognize the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia in patients who are pregnant or in the immediate peripartum period. This has caused missed diagnosis of late-presenting pre-eclampsia until the patient has had a seizure or other end severe organ dysfunction. Better recognition and training on the full spectrum of this condition is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice, a 20-year old female with no significant past medical history is brought in by ambulance with worsening upper abdominal pain onset 1 week ago when she woke up. She has felt nauseous and has vomited one time this morning. Two days ago, she began to feel short of breath. She states that it has been getting worse and she is now having trouble lying flat. She was hypertensive with EMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 20-year old female 5 weeks postpartum (G1T1A0) after a cesarean section is brought in by ambulance with worsening upper abdominal pain onset 1 week ago, 2 days of worsening dyspnea and a new severe headache. The patient is found to be increasingly hypertensive and eventually has a seizure. As the patient’s condition deteriorates the team must determine the cause of this patient’s symptoms (pre-eclampsia) and aggressively treatment her symptoms with IV magnesium, IV anti-hypertensives, IV anti-epileptics and eventually, intubation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the Case Here: <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pp-preeclampsia.docx\">Late Post Partum Pre-eclampsia</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pp-pe-cxr.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>From: <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Late-postpartum-preeclampsia-induced-acute-edema%2C-a-Rua-Costa/06f9edc1fc8a1a569b5e77f41f4cd6b0ba3bca30#extracted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rua <em>et al</em>. 2018</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/03/30/late-post-partum-pre-eclampsia/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4661\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4661\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/03/30/late-post-partum-pre-eclampsia/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4661\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4661\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4661-68e959bb2edaf\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4661&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4661-68e959bb2edaf&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4661-68e959bb2edaf\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/intubation/\" rel=\"tag\">intubation</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/pre-eclampsia/\" rel=\"tag\">pre-eclampsia</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/seizure/\" rel=\"tag\">seizure</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

He completed medical school in Calgary, and EM residency in Victoria through the University of British Columbia Island Program. Prior to medicine, he studied electrical engineering, and has been programming and developing software for over 20 years. Outside of clinical work, he runs several simulation-based education initiatives, and develops software at the intersection of medicine, education, and technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical simulation has become a fixture for most undergraduate and postgraduate medical training programs. It offers many benefits around team dynamics, manual skills, and medical decision-making. Designing cases for simulation is an involved process performed by expert clinicians and involves generating a variety of complex and clinically-realistic materials.  SimLab (<a href=\"https://simlab.resuscitate.io/\">https://simlab.resuscitate.io</a>) is an application for generating realistic lab test values and lab reports, representing various diseases, for use in medical simulation cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Drudgery of Creating Lab Reports</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing long lists of laboratory values for simulation cases is a tedious and error-prone task. Most clinicians do not memorize normal ranges for many laboratory tests, and instead rely on EMRs and lab reports to indicate out-of-range values. Furthermore, many lab tests are non-independent and related to other lab tests, or require correction for other lab results. Educators producing mock lab reports must frequently look up reference normal ranges, or remember to calculate or correct related lab values, processes that can lead to errors and in-simulation distraction from the topic at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regimented referencing and cataloguing is an area in which computer software excels. It is relatively trivial to generate normally-distributed random results, to maintain a database of normal ranges, and to calculate derived labs in a software program. We therefore set out to create a software package for generating simulated lab reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Answer? SimLab</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SimLab was conceived as an open-source, free to use web application for clinical medical educators. It runs inside a web browser using a combination of modern web technologies. Lab results are calculated as either normally-distributed values based on their generally accepted reference ranges [1, 2], or as derived values. Derived values are results that are linked to another lab result. For instance, hemoglobin and hematocrit vary together with a high correlation. Having a lab report with a hemoglobin of 65 g/L, but a hematocrit of 0.5 would be unrealistic. Instead, a hemoglobin is generated for the patient’s context, and the hematocrit is then derived from, or calculated on the basis of, the hemoglobin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lab results can also be manually modified by the user in order to override the generated defaults. This will also update any results that depend on the edited result (for instance, if hemoglobin is changed, hematocrit will update). This can be prevented by either locking a test result, or by overriding the derived test as well. The combination of these features allow any set of lab results to be created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When users sign in, the application allows lab reports to be saved and loaded, so that reports can be created for future use. They can also be shared with other users with a link, allowing collaboration between educators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the application produces a formatted lab list that can be printed to paper or to PDF and used in simulation cases. Results have flags such as high, low, critically high, critically low, or abnormal. They display appropriate units and decimal precision, increasing realism for trainees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But What Does it Look Like?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The current version of SimLab boasts many features. Lab reports can be generated, values edited manually, and the results printed (Figure 1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/86UZVZVyZlTpG1Rs3PU_DJLvm-HW0RAy8bo0wstlWWPjRYEnItrPLr0KpzEFHiDBGHzpdoJtzqeHohkPYKeM3nU1yUjGbG4Jg7AJ4aV-CjZx_iGwxq0zGZNGWD4ED5y5e8QLw2O2\" width=\"472\" height=\"500\"><br><em>Figure 1: A lab report in the process of being created</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can enter patient name, medical record number, and demographics, and demographic factors will affect lab results in a realistic fashion (e.g. pediatric patients have a different normal range for hemoglobin than adult patients).

There is a contact page in the application (accessible from the top bar), and we encourage anyone with feedback to use it to get in touch with us so that we can continue to improve the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Next Steps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a host of new features in development, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Improved ABG calculation – currently values are estimated and can occasionally result in unrealistic results.</li><li>Exporting of lab reports in PDF, Excel, and Word formats</li><li>Changeable units for lab results – for instance, able to switch between U.S. and Canadian units for tests such as glucose.</li><li>More lab tests</li><li>More diseases</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is open-source, and the source code can be viewed, downloaded, forked, and modified on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/resusio\">https://github.com/resusio</a>).

Stephanie Pilieci and David Ha. Dr. Pilieci received her MD from the University of Alberta and is currently a PGY-2 resident in the FRCPC-EM program. Dr. Ha is a staff emergency physician at the University of Alberta and the Assistant Program Director of the FRCPC-EM program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why IT matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the covid-19 pandemic started, guidelines for safe airway practice included: the use of<br>video laryngoscopy, the avoidance of active bagging and the minimization of staff members in<br>intubation rooms. However, these guidelines will often need to be overruled if there is a failed<br>intubation attempt. This case is designed for groups to practice pandemic airway management<br>when the Plan A video intubation method fails. Specific issues to address include: the need for<br>bagging a patient in extremis, coordinating having the backup physician enter the room to help<br>and the need for bringing in extra supraglottic and surgical airway equipment if the situation<br>warrants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Johnson, a 60-year old man was found at the bottom of 3 steps at home by his wife. He is obtunded with obvious bruising to head. EMS has placed him in a C-spine collar and provided supplemental oxygen. He was swabbed for COVID yesterday due to a new cough and fever and the results are still pending.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 60-year-old male with obvious head injury and respiratory failure arrives to the ED in C-spine precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the c-spine immobilization and COVID precautions, the team tries hyperangulated video laryngoscopy in their initial airway attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this attempt will not be successful and the patient will desaturate, necessitating bag-valve masking. At this point, ventilation will become difficult, even with optimized two-person BVM technique or placement of a supraglottic airway. The team leader will be required to exhaust the entire difficult airway algorithm, calling for addition supplies and personnel and finally securing an airway with a surgical approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the Case here: <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/covid-difficult-airway-1.docx\">COVID Difficult Airway</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4636\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/02/02/covid-19-difficult-airway/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4636\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4636\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4636\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2021/02/02/covid-19-difficult-airway/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4636\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4636\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4636-68e959bf2ce7a\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4636&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4636-68e959bf2ce7a&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4636-68e959bf2ce7a\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/covid19/\" rel=\"tag\">COVID19</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/difficult-airway/\" rel=\"tag\">difficult airway</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/respiratory-failure/\" rel=\"tag\">respiratory failure</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}

Dr. Evtushevski is an Emergency Medicine resident at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver Island Site. Prior to this, he completed a BSc in Neuroscience at McGill University followed by his MD at the University of British Columbia. He has interests in neurologic emergencies, critical care and medical education, particularly through the ever-expanding FOAMed world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracheostomy patients are infrequently seen in the emergency department, leading to an unfamiliarity around important anatomical considerations and tracheostomy hardware management. These individuals can harbour acutely life-threatening pathology, with the most feared being the tracheoinnominate artery fistula. This diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion and a sequence of rapid interventions to protect the airway from on-going hemorrhage, temporize the bleeding via a HALO procedure (Utley maneuver), and stabilize the patient for definitive OR management. The team leader’s crisis resource management skills will be strained in this case given the multitude of serious competing life-threats, navigation of unfamiliar and complex airway anatomy, and the utilization of a HALO procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EMS called by partner after spontaneous frank red blood per tracheostomy tube 40 min ago. Stopped on initial assessment but now increased red blood output again on route to hospital. Difficulty breathing, agitated. 10 minutes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 50-year-old male with a recently placed tracheostomy presents to the emergency department following sudden onset, brisk bleeding from his tracheostomy tube. He is in distress with on-going bleeding and hemodynamic instability. The team leader needs to identify the importance of immediate definitive airway control and on-going hemorrhage resuscitation with the most likely culprit being a tracheoinnominate artery fistula. A high-acuity, low opportunity (HALO) procedure – Utley maneuver – will be utilized as salvage therapy to temporize the patients bleeding. Early consultation with surgical colleagues for definitive hemorrhage control is paramount. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE: </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tif-bleed.docx\">Tracheoinnominate Artery Fistula</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tif-bleed.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download>Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4630\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/picture1-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1088,620\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"picture1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=700\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4630\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=150 150w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=300 300w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png?w=768 768w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/picture1.png 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Source = Image source: K.

Her interests include trauma and resuscitation. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Children are susceptible to polytrauma via blunt force mechanisms.  Pediatric trauma resuscitation is stressful and often involves multiple competing priorities.  The presence of emotional family members adds significantly to the cognitive load and stress, so practicing CRM principles is important to reduce the impact of human factors in real life. This case allows both senior and junior physicians to practice CRM principles and medical management of complex pediatric polytrauma patients including intubation and hemodynamic resuscitation, as well as communication skills with family members and consultants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2.5 year old patient brought straight to the resuscitation room after a fall from a 9m balcony. The child is crying, responding to pain, and is not yet on monitors nor do they have IV access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2.5 year old child falls from the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor balcony and presents to a community hospital. The team is expected to coordinate a thorough trauma survey. The patient will initially demonstrate compensated shock requiring aggressive resuscitation. After this initial phase, findings of severe head injury will become apparent. The team must optimize the patient for transfer to definitive care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE:</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a

She has completed a fellowship in Translational Simulation and Team Performance at Gold Coast University Hospital in Australia. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Acute asthma exacerbations in children are extremely common. Most asthmatic exacerbations respond quickly to basic treatment with beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and steroids. This case highlights the management of those patients who need treatment that goes beyond the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically ill pediatric patients are anxiety provoking for many emergency medicine providers and simulation can help prepare individual providers, enhance team dynamics and test clinical systems. This cases pushes participants to the furthest reach of asthma treatment for a young, vulnerable patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 5-year-old boy arrives via EMS with increased work of breathing. He has known asthma and has been using his puffer more over the past 3 days. He has been given one dose of nebulized salbutamol on route with paramedics. He is audibly wheezy and appears unwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 5-year-old male with a history of asthma presents with a three-days of cough, wheeze and worsening shortness of breath.  The team must recognize severe asthma and initiate usual asthma treatment, but the child does not respond to these basic treatments and continues to worsen. The team should escalate management – epinephrine, magnesium, ketamine. The patient continues to tire and requires intubation. Post-intubation, the team must optimize ventilator settings/paralyze/bear hug. If not treated aggressively, the patient will become  hypoxic and bradycardic, potentially leading to arrest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the case here: <a

Donovan MacDonald and Daniel Ovakim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. MacDonald is a PGY-5 Emergency Medicine resident at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver Island Site. He is passionate about medical education, simulation, and mentorship. He believes simulation is an excellent vehicle for improving teamwork, working relationships, and ultimately, patient care. Prior to residency, he completed his undergraduate medical degree at the University of Saskatchewan and still considers himself a prairie boy at heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Ovakim works as a Critical Care Physician in Victoria, British Columbia and as a Medical Toxicologist for the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC). He is a clinical associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of British Columbia. His professional interests include providing toxicology education to residents and medical students, as well as in the critical care management of poisoned patients. Dr. Ovakim received his medical degree from the University of Toronto, and completed an Internal Medicine residency, followed by fellowships in Critical Care Medicine, and Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology at The University of Western Ontario. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta blockers are widely prescribed in the community and though significant overdose ingestions may be uncommon, they may present with considerable hemodynamic instability. In addition, medical management can be complex and require several infrequently utilized therapies. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>44-year-old male with an intentional overdose ingestion.

Decontamination strategies should be utilized alongside consultation with poison control. Patient clinically deteriorates as the drug reaches peak effects, requiring IV fluids, atropine, calcium, glucagon, multi-dose vasopressors, high dose insulin, and a discussion around potential

James Leung and Meagan Doyle. Dr. James Leung is an Assistant Professor and Attending Physician in the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  He is the Director of Simulation for Pediatric Emergency Medicine at McMaster University. He is a design thinker, passionate about understanding the translational outcomes of simulation on improving the care of children. Dr Doyle is a Clinical Assistant Professor at McMaster University and Attending Physician at McMaster Children’s Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking care of the sickest children in the emergency department needs more than individual excellence. It requires a robust, coordinated effort by the bedside team and the entire hospital-wide system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case was designed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to assess and improve team safety and preparedness to effectively manage a critically ill pediatric patient with cardiogenic shock from multi-system inflammatory syndrome, possibly linked to<br>COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elliot, a seven-year old boy, is brought to the emergency department after six days of fever and lethargy. He has a rash, diarrhea and decreased urine output. Both his parents are healthcare workers with possible COVID-19 exposures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 7-year old boy has suspected COVID-19 with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. He presents moderately unwell, but gets progressively sicker in the resuscitation bay, going into cardiogenic shock. This must be treated with careful fluid resuscitation, and eventually vasopressors. A novel option for push-dose vasopressor is explored. Cardiology and PICU should be involved early in the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Downlad the case here: <a

She is interested in medical education and critical care. The scenario was reviewed by Dr. Chafika Lasfer (Certified Emergency Medicine Consultant) and Dr. Yasser Armaghan (Emergency Medicine Specialist). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the emergency department we frequently encounter critically ill patients brought into the resuscitation area with minimal history who require multiple emergency interventions in a time sensitive manner. This case highlights prioritization of assessment and treatment goals, clinical assessment in suspected aortic dissection, utilization of bedside ultrasound, and important management steps in aortic dissection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>53 year old male with uncontrolled hypertension and sudden onset back pain with non-bloody emesis. Brought in by paramedics to the resuscitation area very agitated and combative with a BP reading of 240/120. He has a normal blood glucose. No history of seizures, loss of consciousness, fever, or substance use. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 53 year old male with untreated hypertension presents with a history of vomiting, back pain and acute agitation. Once he is sedated, assessment will reveal an acute aortic dissection. He will require prompt treatment, intubation, and disposition planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE:</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a

She is an emergency physician at The Ottawa Hospital and Lecturer at the University of Ottawa. She has a special interest in simulation and resuscitation, and is a Simulation Educator for the University of Ottawa FRCP and CCFP emergency medicine residency programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically ill patients often require aggressive treatment. But all critical care procedures and medications carry inherent side effects and risks. Emergency physicians who provide critical care must be able to recognize the acute complications of critical interventions and know how to correct them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An elderly patient with COPD on home oxygen arrives at the ED with EMS with severe shortness of breath. He is hypoxic and agitated. He is placed in a resuscitation room and requires immediate medical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 68-year old man with COPD requiring home oxygen presents with respiratory failure. He is hypoxic, hypercarbic and agitated and will require intubation. Dissociative-dosed ketamine and BiPAP can facilitate pre-oxygenation. After a successful intubation, the high pressure alarms on the ventilator will go off. The team leader must troubleshoot the high ventilation pressures until they find and treat a tension pneumothorax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE: <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/copde-w-ptx-1.docx\">COPDE with Pneumothorax</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4517\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,572\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=700\" width=\"700\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4517\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=700 700w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=150 150w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=300 300w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=768 768w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pulmonary-disease-pattern-copd-ecg.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><figcaption>EKG from: <a href=\"https://litfl.com/ecg-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Life in the Fast Lane</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4518\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2320,2828\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=246\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=700\" width=\"700\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4518\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=700 700w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=1400 1400w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=123 123w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=246 246w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=768 768w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3.jpg?w=840 840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><figcaption>Case courtesy of Dr Jeremy Jones, <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/\">Radiopaedia.org</a>.

Alexandra Stefan and Marissa Lu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Stefan (@astefan12) is an emergency physician at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network, and assistant professor in the Division of Emergency Medicine, University of Toronto. She is the Co-Director of Postgraduate Education in the Sunnybrook Emergency Department. Her interests include physician wellness, medical education, global health education, and she has been faculty for several teaching trips with the Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration. She believes that simulation is valuable education tool for health care providers to develop and practice a broad range of clinical skills, from ACLS to goals of care discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Lu is a PGY1 Emergency Medicine resident at the University of Toronto. Her interests include medical education (particularly in-situ simulation and pedagogy) and physician wellness. She completed her BSc (Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour) at McMaster and her MD at the University of Toronto.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>TB is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While it is relatively rare to have TB present as tamponade secondary to pericarditis, it is a recognized complication that requires emergent management. It is important to think about and investigate for TB in any patient with risk factors and constitutional symptoms and this case provides a great opportunity to discuss this along with the emergency management of pericardial tamponade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You are working in the acute area of the ED of a community hospital.  You are called to assess a patient by the RN who is concerned about the patient’s respiratory status. You meet Mr. Tesfaye and his cousin; the patient is complaining of chest pain and severe shortness of breath.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 38 year-old man (Ethiopian refugee) with untreated HIV and past history of TB, presents to the emergency department (ED) with anterior chest pain, shortness of breath and hypotension. He was seen 3 days prior by a walk-in clinic and referred to the ED with chest pain and ECG showing pericarditis, but did not attend the ED until symptoms were severe. In the ED, patient quickly progresses to profound shock and has a PEA arrest. POCUS will show a large pericardial effusion and tamponade. Team members are to initiate CPR, manage the arrest and treat the effusion using bedside pericardiocentesis in order to obtain return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3

Johnny Huang, Krista Dowhos and Lorraine Colpitts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Johnny Huang is a family medicine resident at McMaster University. He is interested in medical education and health services research around Emergency Medicine. Outside of medicine, His hobbies include traveling, various sports leagues and sports analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Krista Dowhos (twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kdowhos?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@KDowhos</a>) is an emergency medicine resident at McMaster University. She was born and raised in Thunder Bay, where she completed her undergraduate medical training. She is passionate about simulation and all things FOAMEd, especially the production of infographics for knowledge translation in Emergency Medicine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Lorraine Colpitts is an emergency physician at Grand River and St. Mary’s General Hospitals. As an Assistant Clinical Professor and Regional Educational Lead at McMaster University, Dr. Colpitts is involved in teaching undergraduate and post-graduate learners at the Waterloo Regional Campus. She is also heavily involved in the local simulation program for Emergency Medicine learners. When she is not working, Dr Colpitts spends her time wrangling her children, making school lunches and cleaning under her kitchen table</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why it Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cornerstones of sepsis management are identification of sepsis, early antibiotics, appropriate fluid resuscitation and source control. While straight-forward in concept, patient factors such as co-morbidities and medications can make this challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case will challenge learners to think about sepsis diagnosis and management in the context of a patient with a significant cardiac history and a dangerous source of infection — the septic ureteric stone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clinical Vignette</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A 59-year-old woman as been experiencing 7 days of dysuria, urinary frequency, and fever. This was preceded by intermittent left flank pain that has now become constant. She called EMS due to worsening left flank pain, nausea, and decreased PO intake. She had a heart attack with stent placement five years ago and has a decreased ejection fraction at baseline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Summary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Denise is a 59-year-old female who presents with a 7-day history of urinary symptoms, fever, and left flank pain. She has a history of STEMI 5 years ago with chronic left-sided heart failure. She becomes unstable in the ER, requiring judicious fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and empiric antibiotic treatment. The team leader needs to consider the history and arrange renal imaging to discover the severe sepsis is secondary to an infected ureteric calculus.  From there, emergent urologic consultation and admission to hospital are warranted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Download the Case here: <a

She is interested in medical education and point of care ultrasound (POCUS). She is currently completing a Masters of Education at the University of Ottawa and a fellowship in POCUS at McGill University. Anali believes simulation is an essential method in teaching health professionals the thought and operational processes behind team-work. She completed her BSc at the University of Waterloo, her MSc in Human Kinetics at the University of Ottawa, and her Medical Degree at McGill University. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harrish Gangatharan is a third-year medical student at McGill University, with a BMSc in Physiology and Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences from Western University. Prior to medical school, Harrish implemented and managed the Scribe Program at the Jewish General Hospital Emergency Department. His involvement in clinical simulation began as a SIM technician at the Markham-Stouffville Hospital and he has since worked towards providing simulation experiences to McGill’s medical students through the Emergency Medicine Interest Group. Harrish aspires to specialize in emergency medicine and has a keen interest in quality improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY IT MATTERS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While local anesthetic systemic toxicity is rare, it is important that learners are able to identify the most common signs and symptoms and begin the care required for this important iatrogenic condition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case provides an opportunity to discuss ACLS care (and modifications to it) in toxicology, toxic dose thresholds for common local anesthetics, and the nuances around LAST including lipid emulsion therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CLINICAL VIGNETTE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>65-year-old male presents after sustaining a fall in the shower. He has a femoral neck fracture and large laceration on his scalp. A medical student has repaired his laceration. You are called to the bedside as the patient has started to complain of blurry vision, paresthesias and “twitchiness”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CASE SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A femoral nerve block has just been performed on a 65-year-old male who sustained a right femoral neck fracture. The patient also sustained a laceration to the scalp which was repaired by the medical student. The patient is now complaining of blurry vision, paresthesias, and “twitchiness”. The patient progresses on to seizure followed by cardiac arrest and will need high quality ACLS care along with lipid emulsion therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOWNLOAD THE CASE HERE: </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity.docx\">Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity</a><a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity.docx\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download>Download</a></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4459\" data-permalink=\"https://emsimcases.com/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=700\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4459\" srcset=\"https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg 1024w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://emsimcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b09b14ffbf27af85acc6fa9f569d95_jumbo.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>XR from <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/cases/femoral-neck-fracture-1\">Radiopaedia</a></p>\n<div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-4455\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2020/08/11/last/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-twitter-4455\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-twitter-4455\" hidden>Click to share on X (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>X</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-4455\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://emsimcases.com/2020/08/11/last/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" aria-labelledby=\"sharing-facebook-4455\">\n\t\t\t\t<span id=\"sharing-facebook-4455\" hidden>Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span>Facebook</span>\n\t\t\t</a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded\" id=\"like-post-wrapper-80525781-4455-68e959e0418a4\" data-src=\"//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251010#blog_id=80525781&amp;post_id=4455&amp;origin=emsimcases.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=80525781-4455-68e959e0418a4&amp;domain=emsimcases.com\" data-name=\"like-post-frame-80525781-4455-68e959e0418a4\" data-title=\"Like or Reblog\"><div class=\"likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder\" style=\"height: 55px;\"><span class=\"button\"><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class=\"sd-text-color\"></span><a class=\"sd-link-color\"></a></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div></div>\t</div>\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\">Tagged <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/lipid-emulsion/\" rel=\"tag\">lipid emulsion</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/resuscitation-2/\" rel=\"tag\">resuscitation</a>, <a href=\"https://emsimcases.com/tag/toxicology/\" rel=\"tag\">Toxicology</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t</article>\n\nGenerate Initial_Vitals and any State vitals that are appropriate for this case's progression.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or explanations."}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":3000}}
