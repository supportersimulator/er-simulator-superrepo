    "reasoning": "Clear outcomes focused on anchoring bias recognition. Progression from subtle to obvious traps is pedagogically sound. Fills critical gap in cognitive debiasing training. However, retention may be challenged without repeated exposure.",

    "reasoning": "The pathway offers a novel approach by focusing on cognitive biases and diagnostic traps instead of traditional organ-based or symptom-based groupings. While it may not be entirely revolutionary, it challenges conventional curriculum design by addressing how clinicians think rather than what they know. The cases are connected through the theme of cognitive biases, providing a fresh perspective and standing out in a curriculum catalog.",
    "comparison_to_traditional": "Traditional: Organize by organ system or symptom type. This pathway: Organize by cognitive bias and diagnostic errors.",
    "innovation_level": "High - It focuses on cognitive processes involved in diagnosis, which is less commonly addressed in traditional medical education."

Structure doesn't perfectly match OnlineMedEd/Rosh, but aligns with emerging 'thinking skills' trend. Naming is compelling. Target audience (PGY2-3) is large segment.
