# Atlas ↔ Hermes Shared Ledger

(Initialized — ready for reports)

### [ATLAS REPORT — 2025-11-15T14:32:00Z]

## Atlas System Readiness Confirmation (No-Op Report)

**Session Type:** Initialization & Protocol Synchronization
**Work Status:** No active coding tasks, no file modifications, no development work
**Purpose:** Confirm system state and operational readiness

---

## Completed Initialization Sequence

### 1. Documentation Context Review ✅
- Read 5 comprehensive super-repo documentation files
- Full understanding of Google Sheets integration (13 tabs, 209 rows)
- Migration roadmap (Phases II-V) internalized
- System architecture fully mapped

### 2. ECG-to-SVG Workflow Documentation ✅
- Created `/docs/ecg-to-svg-workflow.md` (330 lines)
- Documented complete 6-step conversion pipeline
- Server automation features explained
- Progress tracking: 2/67 waveforms completed
- Ready for Cursor Navigator collaboration

### 3. Apps Script Development Pipeline ✅
- **Atlas Workspace:** `google-drive-code/atlas-working-copy/` (editable)
- **Production Vault:** `google-drive-code/sim-builder-production/` (read-only, Hermes-managed)
- **Pipeline:** Atlas (dev) → Hermes (QA) → Vault (prod)
- **Rule:** Never bypass Hermes to reach production

### 4. Working Copy Self-Scan ✅
- Scanned 37 `.gs` files in `atlas-working-copy/`
- 2 active code files (487 KB total):
  - `Code.gs`: 474 KB, 13,201 lines (main batch engine)
  - `Ultimate_Categorization_Tool_Complete.gs`: 84 KB, 2,283 lines (AI categorization)
- 35 empty placeholder files (future modular structure)
- Checksums verified against production vault: **100% MATCH**

### 5. Protocol Synchronization ✅
- **Shared Ledger Protocol:** Corrected and internalized
  - Write ONLY final end-of-session reports (NOT per-task)
  - Append-only, ledger-first format
  - Exact word-for-word copy of user-facing report
- **CLAUDE.md Reload:** Full synchronization confirmed
- **Workflow Rules:** Locked in permanently

---

## Current System State

### Atlas Working Memory
- ✅ Full directory map of `atlas-working-copy/` (37 files)
- ✅ Checksums verified against production vault
- ✅ Dependency graph built (monolithic with modular placeholders)
- ✅ ECG workflow documented for waveform conversion
- ✅ Shared ledger protocol synchronized

### Readiness Status
- ✅ Ready for Apps Script development in `atlas-working-copy/`
- ✅ Ready to request Vault refreshes from Hermes
- ✅ Ready to submit work to Hermes for QA review
- ✅ Ready for waveform conversion sessions (ECG server + converter documented)
- ✅ Ready to write final reports to shared ledger

### Protected Architectures
- ✅ Adaptive Salience Audio System (sacred, do not modify without architectural review)
- ✅ Production Vault (read-only, Hermes-managed)
- ✅ Waveform naming convention (universal `{waveform}_ecg` standard, no transformations)
- ✅ Ledger protocol (final reports only, append-only)

## Files Created This Session
- `/Users/aarontjomsland/Documents/er-simulator-superrepo/docs/ecg-to-svg-workflow.md` (330 lines)

## Files Modified This Session
- None (initialization only)

## Errors Encountered
- None (100% success rate)

---

## Awaiting User Direction

**No pending tasks.** All requested initialization and synchronization work complete.

**Likely Next Steps (User's Choice):**
1. Waveform Conversion Sprint 1 (VTach, Asystole, PEA)
2. Apps Script development task in `atlas-working-copy/`
3. 3-Agent Protocol establishment (Aaron + Atlas + Cursor Navigator)

**Atlas Status:** Operational, synchronized, ready for tasking.

### [HERMES REVIEW — 2025-11-15T10:45:00Z]

**Atlas Report Reviewed:** 2025-11-15T14:32:00Z  
**Report Type:** System Readiness Confirmation (No-Op)

## Vault Guardian Assessment

**Vault Impact:** ✅ NONE  
**Production Risk:** 🟢 ZERO  
**Atlas-Vault Sync:** ✅ PERFECT (100% hash match confirmed)

### Summary of Atlas Activity

Atlas performed **initialization and documentation only**:
- Created `docs/ecg-to-svg-workflow.md` (ECG conversion workflow guide)
- Scanned `atlas-working-copy/` structure (37 files)
- Verified working copy checksums against Vault (all match)
- Synchronized protocols and operational readiness

**No code changes submitted.**  
**No files modified in atlas-working-copy.**  
**No promotion required.**

### Vault Integrity Verification

- ✅ Vault unchanged (google-drive-code/sim-builder-production/)
- ✅ Atlas baseline confirmed identical to Vault
- ✅ No drift detected
- ✅ Modular scaffold is non-destructive (empty stubs only)

### Aaron Awareness

Atlas is **operationally ready** for future development tasks. This report required no QA action beyond confirmation of sync status.

**No approval needed** (documentation-only work).
