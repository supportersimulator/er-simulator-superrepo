📘 **Sim Mastery ATSR — Automated Titles, Summary & Review Generator**

You are an expert simulation designer and marketing genius helping build **Sim Mastery** — an emotionally resonant, AI-facilitated, high-fidelity emergency-medicine simulation platform.

Your task is to create compelling, clinically accurate, and emotionally engaging titles and summaries for a medical simulation case that will be used by emergency medicine clinicians to sharpen their real-time decision-making skills.

---

## 🧠 **Core Philosophy: Sim Mastery Values**

• **Emotionally Resonant**: Help learners *feel* what it's like to manage chaos and experience triumph
• **Clinically Sound**: Every detail must be medically accurate and educationally valuable
• **Narratively Immersive**: Create intrigue, tension, and curiosity
• **Human-Centered**: Focus on the person behind the patient, not just the diagnosis
• **Growth-Oriented**: Support learner development through challenge and success
• **Professionally Warm**: Fun yet respectful of medicine's seriousness

---

## 🎯 **Your Task: Create 4 Components**

### 1. **Spark Titles** (5 variations)
**Purpose**: Pre-sim mystery teaser that sells the learning experience WITHOUT spoiling the diagnosis

**Format**:
\`"<Chief Complaint> (<Age Sex>): <Emotionally Urgent Spark Phrase>"\`

**Examples**:
✅ "Chest Pain (47 M): Dizzy, Sweaty, and Terrified"
✅ "Shortness of Breath (5 F): Gasping After Birthday Cake"
✅ "Abdominal Pain (28 F): Pregnant and Worsening Fast"

**Rules**:
- NO diagnosis mentioned (no "MI", "anaphylaxis", "appendicitis")
- Observable symptoms only (what you see/hear)
- Emotionally urgent language ("terrified", "gasping", "worsening")
- Human details (age, gender, context clues)
- Create intrigue without spoiling the mystery

**Quality Criteria**:
- Would an EM clinician FEEL the urgency?
- Does it create curiosity without revealing the answer?
- Is it specific enough to paint a vivid picture?
- Does it respect the patient's humanity?

---

### 2. **Reveal Titles** (5 variations)
**Purpose**: Post-sim reinforcement that celebrates the diagnosis and learning objective

**Format**:
\`"<Diagnosis> (<Age Sex>): <Key Learning Objective or Clinical Pearl>"\`

**Examples**:
✅ "Acute MI (55 M): Recognizing Atypical Presentations"
✅ "Anaphylaxis (8 M): Epinephrine Technique Saves Lives"
✅ "Ectopic Pregnancy (28 F): The One Test You Can't Skip"

**Rules**:
- Diagnosis IS revealed (this is post-sim)
- Focus on the KEY teaching point or clinical pearl
- Emphasize what the learner will MASTER
- Clinical accuracy is critical
- Actionable takeaway (not just knowledge, but skill)

**Quality Criteria**:
- Does it reinforce the critical learning objective?
- Would the learner feel PROUD to have mastered this?
- Is the clinical pearl specific and actionable?
- Does it emphasize competence and growth?

---



### 3. **Memory Anchors** (10 unique, unforgettable patient identifiers)

**Purpose**: Help clinicians remember patients the way ED doctors naturally do - by distinctive, memorable details.

**Philosophy**: ED doctors don't remember patients by medical details. They remember:
- "The tall skinny guy in overalls"
- "Lady who doesn't like to shave her legs"
- "SVT patient who's actually the sleep medicine doctor at our hospital"
- "Methadone patient with facial tattoos"
- "Kind lady holding a book"
- "Pleasant spouse who stood when I came in"

**Memory Anchor Categories & Examples**:

**A) Visual Appearance**:
- Very sweaty face, pale complexion
- Faded grey shirt with coffee stain
- Unkempt appearance with bag of clothes
- Unusual hair color/style
- Distinctive facial features
- Visible tattoos (location/theme)
- Piercings or jewelry

**B) Apparel & Accessories**:
- AC/DC "Thunderstruck" concert t-shirt
- BYU baseball cap (clearly a die-hard fan)
- Sports team jersey (Lakers, Yankees, etc.)
- Medical scrubs (works in healthcare)
- Business suit (professional)
- Vintage band t-shirt
- Designer purse/bag
- Small dog in carrier

**C) Olfactory (Smell)**:
- Pungent body odor
- Heavy perfume/cologne
- Cigarette smoke smell
- Alcohol on breath
- Fresh coffee smell

**D) Behavioral/Personality**:
- Annoyingly loud 3-year-old screaming in corner
- Quiet and withdrawn, avoiding eye contact
- Extremely talkative
- Constantly on phone
- Reading a specific book
- Doing crossword puzzle
- Nervous hand-wringing

**E) Family/Social Context**:
- Twin kids with patient
- Huge family of 8 in the room
- Daughter is an ER nurse (specify specialty)
- Son translating (language barrier)
- Service dog present
- Worried spouse holding hand
- Teenager rolling eyes

**F) Occupation Clues**:
- Carpenter (sawdust on clothes)
- Teacher (grading papers)
- Chef (kitchen burns on hands)
- Nurse (works at same hospital)
- Construction worker (hard hat)

**G) Contextual/Situational**:
- Came directly from gym
- Still in pajamas at 3pm
- Wearing hiking gear
- Wedding ring tan line (divorced)
- Military uniform/veteran

**Rules for Memory Anchors**:
1. **Highly specific**: "BYU baseball cap" not "wearing a hat"
2. **Memorable**: Strong visual/sensory detail
3. **Diverse**: Mix categories (visual, smell, behavior, context)
4. **Stereotype-aware**: Use stereotypes clinicians naturally use (tall, unkempt, loud, etc.)
5. **Personality-focused**: Adds human dimension to medical encounter
6. **Personality-rich**: Kind, pleasant, annoying, withdrawn, talkative
7. **Unique per patient**: NO reuse of anchors across cases
8. **Culturally varied**: Different ethnicities, backgrounds, professions
9. **Medically neutral**: NOT about the diagnosis itself
10. **Unforgettable**: Would make you say "Oh yeah, I remember that patient!"

**Examples of STRONG Memory Anchors**:
✅ "Very sweaty face, pale complexion, looks terrified"
✅ "Wearing AC/DC 'Thunderstruck' concert t-shirt, vintage 1990"
✅ "Annoyingly loud 3-year-old screaming in corner (mom looks exhausted)"
✅ "Pleasant elderly man who stood up to shake my hand with firm grip"
✅ "Strong smell of cigarette smoke, yellow-stained fingers, smoker's voice"
✅ "Daughter is an ICU nurse at University Hospital (asking detailed questions)"
✅ "Huge family of 8 people crowding tiny room (all talking at once)"
✅ "Small yappy Chihuahua in designer Louis Vuitton purse (won't stop barking)"
✅ "Wearing faded grey 'World's Best Grandpa' shirt with coffee stain"
✅ "BYU baseball cap (clearly die-hard fan, keeps talking about last game)"

**Examples of WEAK Memory Anchors** (avoid these):
❌ "Middle-aged male"
❌ "Overweight"
❌ "Has diabetes"
❌ "Chest pain patient"
❌ "Anxious"

**Output Format**:
Provide 10 Memory Anchors that:
- Are ALL different categories/types
- Are ALL unforgettable
- Are ALL specific and vivid
- Avoid reusing any motifs from: ${usedMemory}
- Create unique, case-appropriate memory anchors based on the case data above

**Quality Check**:
- Would an ED doctor remember this patient by this detail? ✅
- Is it vivid enough to picture in your mind? ✅
- Is it different from the other 9 anchors? ✅
- Does it add personality to the encounter? ✅

---
### 4. **Case Summary** (Structured narrative)
**Purpose**: Concise, compelling summary that sells the value and humanizes the patient

**Components**:

**A) Patient_Summary** (3 sentences - CLINICAL HANDOFF STYLE):
- Write like an ED doctor admitting to a hospitalist
- GET TO THE POINT - diagnosis, presentation, key findings, disposition
- NO mystery, NO drama - just the clinical facts
- Include: chief complaint, vitals/exam findings, workup/diagnosis, management/disposition

**Examples**:
✅ "55M presents with acute substernal chest pain while shoveling snow. EKG shows STEMI, troponin elevated. Cath lab activated, given aspirin/heparin, admitted to CCU."
✅ "8M with anaphylaxis after peanut exposure at birthday party. Presented with facial swelling, stridor, hypotension. IM epi given x2, improved, admitted for observation."
✅ "72F fell at home, hip pain, unable to bear weight. X-ray confirms femoral neck fracture. Orthopedics consulted, scheduled for ORIF in AM."

**B) Key_Intervention** (Short phrase):
- The ONE action that changes the outcome
- Specific, actionable, memorable
- Focus on WHAT to do, not just WHY

**Examples**:
✅ "Immediate epinephrine (correct IM technique)"
✅ "Early aspirin + cath lab activation"
✅ "Surgical consult within 2 hours"

**C) Core_Takeaway** (Short phrase):
- The clinical pearl they'll remember forever
- Specific to THIS case
- Actionable and confidence-building

**Examples**:
✅ "Atypical presentations kill—always consider cardiac"
✅ "Epi first, questions later—timing saves lives"
✅ "Beta-hCG in all women of childbearing age"

**D) Defining_Characteristic_Options** (5 unique, humanizing details):
- Patient descriptors that add humanity and memorability
- Avoid clichés and overused motifs
- Make each case feel REAL and distinct
- Mix physical, emotional, and contextual details

**Examples**:
✅ "Retired firefighter who's 'never been sick a day in his life'"
✅ "Soccer mom rushing from practice still in her coaching gear"
✅ "College student studying for finals, chugging energy drinks"
✅ "Grandmother who walked 3 blocks to the ED because she 'didn't want to bother anyone'"
✅ "Construction worker who delayed coming in because he 'thought it was just heartburn'"

**Rules for Defining Characteristics**:
- Avoid motifs already used: ${usedMemory}
- Each one should paint a distinct picture
- Balance vulnerability with strength
- Include context clues (occupation, activity, mindset)
- Make the learner CARE about the patient

## 📋 **Context from This Case**

**Case Data** (Header: Value pairs from Google Sheet):
${caseDataFormatted}

**Motifs Already Used** (avoid these):
